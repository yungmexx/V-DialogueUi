How to use:

You can either go two routes, first is trigger the event that you can use in loop

TriggerEvent('v-dialogue:showtext', CHANGEME )

Set CHANGEME to whatever you want make sure its in " "

EXAMPLE: TriggerEvent('v-dialogue:showtext', "This is an Example")

How to hide Ui:

EXAMPLE: TriggerEvent('v-dialogue:hidetext')

Or you can export it to go based on a timer

How to use:

exports['v-dialogueui']:showTextUI( CHANGEME, time)

Set CHANGEME to whatever you want make sure its in " " and change time to a number for example: 5000

EXAMPLE: exports['v-dialogueui']:showTextUI('This is an example text', 5000) -- Display the text for 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds)



Credits go to Pata_PataMods on CFX for the ui. All I did was extract the Ui part to use as TriggerEvents
