How to use:

TriggerEvent('v-dialogtext', CHANGEME )

Set CHANGEME to whatever you want make sure its in " " 

EXAMPLE: TriggerEvent('v-dialogtext', "This is an Example" )

How to hide Ui:

TriggerEvent('v-hidetext')


Credits go to Pata_PataMods on CFX for the ui. All I did was extract the Ui part to use as TriggerEvents
